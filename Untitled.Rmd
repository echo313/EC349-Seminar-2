>     them.

    Answer Below
    
| John Rollins General Data Science Methodology Stages | Questions |
|:----------|----------:|
| Business/Problem Understanding  | What problem/question are you trying to solve/answer? | 
| Analytic Approach    | How can you use data to answer this question? | 
| Data Requirements | What data is needed to answer the question? |
| Data Collection | What is the source of the data? How will you collect & receive it? |
| Data Understanding | Is the data indicative of the problem to be solved? |


> 6.  Create an ordered list of at least 3 other Data Science
>     methodologies.

    Answer Below
    
1. Crisp-dm
2. SEMMA
3. KDD

> 7.  Provide and ordered list the weaknesses of the CRISP-DM
>     methodology and how to address them

    Answer Below

1. Outdated -> Add phases (if needed) and define the sub items within each phase
2. Documentation Heavy -> Document enough... but not too much
3. Not a Project Management Approach -> Combine with a team coordination process and Define team roles
4. Can Ignore Stakeholders -> Ensure actionable insight
5. Slow Start -> Iterate quickly

> 8.  Download and include a University of Warwick Logo in your
>     document.

> 9.  Write and execute a code to randomly generate 10 numbers from a
>     normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 3.

    Answer Below

```{r}    
rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd= 3)
```

> 10. Write and execute a code to calculate the mean of 12 random
>     numbers generated from the interval of integers from 5 to 25.

    Answer Below

```{r}
mean(sample(5:25, 12))
```

```{r}
mean(runif(12, min=5, max=25))
```

> 11. Write and execute a code to create a scatter plot containing 12
>     points whose coordinates were randomly geenrated in the interval 5
>     to 25. Provide a title for the figure, label the x and y axis.

    Answer Below
    
```{r}
plot(x=sample(5:25,12), y=sample(5:25, 12), main="twelve random points", xlab="x values", ylab="y values")
```

> 12. Write and execute a code to create a function to calculate
>     standard error. Then, calculate the standard error of a set of 15
>     randomly generated numbers from a normal distribution with mean 12
>     and standard deviation 3.

    Answer Below
    
```{r}
exists("se")
se <-function(a) {
  x<- var(a)
  y<- length(a)
  return(sqrt(x/y))
}
testEg <- rnorm(15, mean = 12, sd =3)
se(testEg)
```

> 13. Given that BMI=kg/m2, where kg is the person’s weight in kilograms
>     and m2is height in meters squared, write and execute a code to
>     create a function that calculates the BMI of who weighs 85kg and
>     is 1.9m tall.

    Answer Below
    
```{r}
exists("bmi")
bmi <- function(weightInKG,heightInMetres) {
  return (weightInKG/heightInMetres^2)
}
bmi(85, 1.9)
```
